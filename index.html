    <h2>About Gopher Auxiliary of Eruthyll</h2>
    <p><b>We connect the land of Eruthyll with the earth.</b> Founded as a fan-based organisation, we are keen on
      providing you with the best services possible that will allow directors to fully enjoy their journey with heroes
      at the Gopher Troupe. We provide services including free Eruthyll.net mailbox and the community-based Eruthyll
      Wiki. Gopher Auxiliary of Eruthyll is not a registered organisation, operation of which is guided by Bilibili HK

    <h2>About Eruthyll.net email addresses</h2>
    <p>Anyone with a qualified existing mailbox can apply for one fully functional mailbox with 50GB of space that ends
      with @eruthyll.net.</p>
    <p>Registration requires a verified email address from a list of major public email service providors including
      Microsoft, Apple and Google and does not require a human verification. <b>Consequently, any email sent through any
        @eruthyll.net address, regardless how real they appear to be, are not from Gopher Auxiliary of Eruthyll or
        BILIBILI HK LIMITED.</b></p>
    <p>Gopher Auxiliary of Eruthyll will only communicate using a @eruthyll.org address (it ends with .org instead of
      .net), while officials will only use @biligame.net or @eruthyll.com address to provide support or send out
      newsletters.</p>
    <p>Your Eruthyll.net account is also needed to contribute to Eruthyll Wiki. Eruthyll.net account is not available
      for in-game registration or login.</p>
