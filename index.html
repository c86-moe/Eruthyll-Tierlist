        <h2>Tips for playing</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                When your character reaches Lv.40, don't spend all your Starlight Revelation on making character wishes. You better wish for decent play inspirations. A whole set of plays could boost your character's ability to another level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember to upgrade your character's skills. Don't let the skill level fall too far behind the character level.
            </li>
            <li>
                The test period only lasts two weeks. Low star-level characters are easier to be fully awakened and aren't necessarily inferior to their high star-level counterparts. Once fully awakened, they could get a significant enhancement. So enhancing your current characters might be a better strategy than going all in to wish for high star-level characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sailing Theatre in the Vessel is a good place for you to have a rest and enjoy leisure time with your troupe girls. If it feels grindy after some battles, make sure to have some fun there.
